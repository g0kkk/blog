There are many solutions to Erling Ellingsen’s <a href="https://alf.nu/alert1">escape.alf.nu</a> XSS challenges and I will be giving the solutions to first few challenges in the set.
I suggest <b>not to</b> read the write-up before you attempting it. It can take several days to solve the challenges depending on the amount of knowledge you’ve on the same. It took me several days to complete up till the first three challenges and I’d be posting here on how to tackle them effectively and also the key points to note upon while solving the challenges.

`Level 0`:
{% highlight python %}
function escape(s) {
  // Warmup.

  return 'console.log("'+s+'");';
}
{% endhighlight %}

Point to be noted to here is first we have to close the `console.log` and then fulfil with the requirement we want.

Solution: `");alert(1);//`
