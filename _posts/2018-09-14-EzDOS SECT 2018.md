This <a href="https://github.com/gokulkrishna01/gokulkrishna01.github.io/tree/master/scripts/SECT/ezdos.com">challenge</a> was fairly easy and one of the first one to be solved as well along with my team mate,<a href="https://twitter.com/jkrshnmenon">4rbit3r</a>!

We were given the file and as the name suggests, it was a `DOS` file. Firing it up in IDA would give you a fair idea of what actually happens and also would help you to see that a key is being taken as the input which is 9 in length.

Further moving ahead, we can see that there is a comparison being done along with the characters shown below:

In the beginning, I was trying to run the file using the DOS emulator which did not work and giving strings command gave me a few strings which was later important. There was a string being moved as you can see here which was nothing else but `1337SHELL` which was a guess as that was the only string which was not being used anywhere else. You can use r2 or gdb to print out what was there in that address, `26Bh`.

The rest was pretty straighforward as the string `1337` stayed there and the rest of our input was being xored `SHEL` and compared with the strings shown below

More of like:
```
if inp[4] != '-':
    exit(0)
if inp[5] ^ buf[4] != 'f':
    exit(0)
```

In order to get the

We can get that the resulting four characters after the `-`:

```
In [1]: chr(ord('S')^ord('f'))
Out[1]: '5'

In [2]: chr(ord('H')^ord('y'))
Out[2]: '1'

In [3]: chr(ord('E')^ord('t'))
Out[3]: '1'

In [4]: chr(ord('L')^ord('y'))
Out[4]: '5'
```

Now we have four characters after `-` which is `5115`. We can see a flag file being opened and hence send the final string to the server where it is hosted.

The final string is, `1337-5115` :)
